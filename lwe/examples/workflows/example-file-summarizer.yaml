# Illustrates a directory-based data pipeline.
#
# Inspired by https://github.com/daveshap/Quickly_Extract_Science_Papers
#
# Files placed in a directory are processed as follows:
#
# 1. Extract the text from the file
# 2. Pass the text to the LLM as context
# 3. Extract the title
# 4. Ask the LLM four questions about the reference text
# 5. Store the results as a conversation, and in a summary file
# 6. If the GITHUB_GIST_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable is set:
#    - Upload the summary file to a Gist
#    - Output the URL of the Gist
#
# Summary files are only written once -- if the summary file for a reference
# file already exists, it's skipped.
#
# An optional `url` parameter can be passed when executing the workflow -- if
# specified, the referenced file will be downloaded prior to processing the
# contents directory.
# NOTE: The URL must be a path to a downloadable file, and end with an extension
# that the text extractor can support, e.g.:
#     /workflow run file-summarizer url="https://example.com/paper.pdf"
