# ChatGPT CLI and Python Wrapper

ChatGPT Wrapper is an open-source unofficial Python API and CLI that lets you interact with ChatGPT.

## Highlights

ðŸ¤– Programmable ChatGPT. The ChatGPT Wrapper lets you use the powerful ChatGPT bot in your *Python scripts* or on the *command line*, making it easy to leverage its functionality into your projects.

ðŸ’¬ Runs in Shell. You can call and interact with ChatGPT in the terminal

## How it works

Run an interactive CLI in the terminal:

See below for details on using ChatGPT as an API from Python.

## Requirements

To use this repository, you need the following python modules: `setuptools`, `playwright` and `rich`. You can install them using:
```
pip install setuptools
pip install playwright
pip install rich
```

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of this software directly from github with pip:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper
```

2. Install a browser in playwright (if you haven't already).  The program will use firefox by default.

```
playwright install firefox
```

3. Start up the program in `install` mode. This opens up a browser window. Log in to ChatGPT in the browser window, then stop the program. 

```bash
chatgpt install
```

4. Restart the program without the `install` parameter to begin using it.

Note: For more help, this [Blog post](https://medium.com/geekculture/using-chatgpt-in-python-eeaed9847e72) provides a visual step-by-step guide for installing this library.

## Usage

### Shell

In addition to directly prompting ChatGPT, The shell provides the following commands:
* `!new` allows to start a new conversation
* `!nav` lets you navigate to a past point in the conversation. Example: `!nav 2`
* `!stream` toggles between streaming mode (streams the raw response from ChatGPT) and markdown rendering (which cannot stream).
* `!read` begins reading multi-line input. Usefull when copy-pasting
* `!file` sends a prompt read from the named file.  Example: `file myprompt.txt`
* `!log` enables logging to a file.  Example: `!log mylog.txt` to enable, or `!log` to disable.
* `!context` lets you load old contexts from the log (previous sessions).  It takes one parameter; a context string from logs.
* `!session` refreshes your session information.  This can resolve errors under certain scenarios.

### Python

To use the `ChatGPT` class as an API for talking to ChatGPT, create an instance of the class and use the `ask` method to send a message to OpenAI and receive the response. For example:

```python
from chatgpt_wrapper import ChatGPT

bot = ChatGPT()
response = bot.ask("Hello, world!")
print(response)  # prints the response from chatGPT
```

The say method takes a string argument representing the message to send to ChatGPT, and returns a string representing the response received from ChatGPT.

You may also stream the response as it comes in from ChatGPT in chunks using the `ask_stream` generator.

## Updates
- 18/01/2022: v0.3.8 - Commands now are run only using !. For instance to enable read mode (for copy-paste and long prompts) you need to write now `!read` instead of `read`. This is to avoid conflicts with the chatgpt prompts. Fixed timeout issue.
- 17/01/2022: v0.3.7 - Added timeout to `ask` method to prevent hanging. Fixed return to terminal breakdown. Streaming output now is activated by default.
