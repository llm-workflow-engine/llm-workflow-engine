## What happend to the original ChatGPT Wrapper project?

See [CHATGPT_WRAPPER.md](CHATGPT_WRAPPER.md)

ChatGPT Wrapper was an amazing tool for its time, thank you to its original creator [mmabrouk](https://github.com/mmabrouk) for all your hard work, it lives on in a new form :)

## Highlights

ü§ñ LWE lets you use the powerful ChatGPT/GPT4 bot from the **command line**.

üí¨ **Runs in Shell**. You can call and interact with ChatGPT/GPT4 in the terminal.

üíª  **Supports official ChatGPT API**. Make API calls directly to the OpenAI ChatGPT endpoint (all supported models accessible by your OpenAI account)

üîå [**Simple plugin architecture**](https://llm-workflow-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html#core-plugins). Extend LWE with custom functionality

üó£ **Supports multiple LLM providers**. Provider plugins allow interacting with other LLMs (GPT-3, Cohere, Hugginface, etc.)

üîÑ[**Build workflows**](https://llm-workflow-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows.html). Easily integrate calls to an LLM into larger workflows via Ansible Playbooks

üîß [**Tool use**](https://llm-workflow-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools.html). (for supported providers)

üê≥ **Docker image**. LWE is also available as a docker image. (experimental)

üêç**Python API**. LWE also has a Python library that lets you use ChatGPT/GPT4 in your Python scripts.
