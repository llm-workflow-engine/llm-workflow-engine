# ChatGPT CLI and Python Wrapper

ChatGPT Wrapper is an open-source unofficial Python API and CLI that lets you interact with ChatGPT.


## Highlights

ðŸ¤– Programmable ChatGPT. The ChatGPT Wrapper lets you use the powerful ChatGPT bot in your *Python scripts* or on the *command line*, making it easy to leverage its functionality into your projects.

ðŸ’¬ Runs in Shell. You can call and interact with ChatGPT in the terminal

## Updates
- 27/02/2023: v0.3.18
  - Added the include addition of !file to any kind of inputs.
- 21/02/2023: v0.3.17
  - Added debug mode (visible browser window).
  - @thehunmonkgroup fixed chat naming.
  - @thehunmonkgroup added !delete command to remove/hide conversations
  - @thehunmonkgroup added --model flag to select model ('default' or 'legacy-paid' or 'legacy-free')
  - @thehunmonkgroup added !editor command to open the current prompt in an editor and send the edited prompt to ChatGPT
  - @thehunmonkgroup added !history command to show the list of the last 20 conversations
  - @NatLee added **docker** support
- 17/02/2023: v0.3.16
  - Ability to open **multiple sessions in parallel**.
  - Code now works with **ChatGPT Plus** subscription.
- 14/02/2023: v0.3.15 - Updated model to text-davinci-002-render-sha (turbo model)
- 14/02/2023: v0.3.11
  - Fixed many bugs with installation. Code is refactored.
  - Now able to use the python wrapper with a **proxy**.
- 18/01/2023: v0.3.8 - Commands now are run only using !. For instance to enable read mode (for copy-paste and long prompts) you need to write now `!read` instead of `read`. This is to avoid conflicts with the chatgpt prompts. Fixed timeout issue.
- 17/01/2023: v0.3.7 - Added timeout to `ask` method to prevent hanging. Fixed return to terminal breakdown. Streaming output now is activated by default.

## How it works

Run an interactive CLI in the terminal:

See below for details on using ChatGPT as an API from Python.

## Requirements

To use this repository, you need  `setuptools` installed. You can install it using `pip install setuptools`. Make sure that you have the last version of pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
To use the !write command, you need to install vipe. In ubuntu, you can install it with `sudo apt install moreutils`, in macos with `brew install moreutils`.

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of this software directly from github with pip:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper
```

2. Install a browser in playwright (if you haven't already).  The program will use firefox by default.

```
playwright install firefox
```

3. Start up the program in `install` mode. This opens up a browser window. Log in to ChatGPT in the browser window, then stop the program. 

```bash
chatgpt install
```

4. Restart the program without the `install` parameter to begin using it.

## Usage

### Shell

In addition to directly prompting ChatGPT, The shell provides the following commands:
* `!help` display help commands, or `!help <command>` to display help for a specific command
* `!exit` or `!quit` to exit the shell
* `!ask` to ask a question (default)
* `!new` allows to start a new conversation
* `!nav` lets you navigate to a past point in the conversation. Example: `!nav 2`
* `!stream` toggles between streaming mode (streams the raw response from ChatGPT) and markdown rendering (which cannot stream).
* `!read` begins reading multi-line input. Usefull when copy-pasting
* `!file` sends a prompt read from the named file.  Example: `file myprompt.txt`
* `!log` enables logging to a file.  Example: `!log mylog.txt` to enable, or `!log` to disable.
* `!context` lets you load old contexts from the log (previous sessions).  It takes one parameter; a context string from logs.
* `!session` refreshes your session information.  This can resolve errors under certain scenarios.
* `!delete` deletes conversation from the webview, by conversation ID, history ID, or current conversation if no argument provided.
* `!editor` opens the current prompt in the default editor (as defined by the EDITOR environment variable) and allows you to edit it.  The edited prompt is then sent to ChatGPT.
* `!history` show recent conversation history, default 20 offset 0, Example `!history` or `!history 10` or `!history 10 5`
* `!title` get/set title of current conversation, or set title by history ID
* `!chat` retrieve chat by ID or history ID. Example: `!chat [id]` or `!chat 2`
* `!switch` Switch to chat by ID or history ID. Example: `!switch [id]` or `!switch 2`

Command arguments can be passed in the following ways:
* --debug: enables debug mode (visible browser window)
* --model: selects model ('default' or 'legacy-paid' or 'legacy-free')
* --browser: selects browser ('firefox' or 'chromium' or 'webkit')
* --log: log prompts and responses to the named file
* --debug-log: debug logging to the named file
* --no-stream: disables streaming mode (and enables markdown rendering)

### Python

To use the `ChatGPT` class as an API for talking to ChatGPT, create an instance of the class and use the `ask` method to send a message to OpenAI and receive the response. For example:

```python
from chatgpt_wrapper import ChatGPT

bot = ChatGPT()
response = bot.ask("Hello, world!")
print(response)  # prints the response from chatGPT
```

The say method takes a string argument representing the message to send to ChatGPT, and returns a string representing the response received from ChatGPT.

You may also stream the response as it comes in from ChatGPT in chunks using the `ask_stream` generator.

## Docker

Build a image for testing `chatgpt-wrapper` with following commands.

```bash
docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it chatgpt-wrapper-container /bin/bash -c "chatgpt install"
```

Then, visit http://localhost:6901/vnc.html with password `headless` and login ChatGPT.
