## How it works

Run an interactive CLI in the terminal:

![kod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4510758/212907070-602d61fe-708d-4a39-aaa2-0e84fcf88dcf.png)

See below for details on using ChatGPT as an API from Python.

## Requirements

To use this repository, you need `setuptools` installed. You can install it using `pip install setuptools`. Make sure that you have the last version of pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
To use the /write command, you need to install vipe. In ubuntu, you can install it with `sudo apt install moreutils`, in macos with `brew install moreutils`

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of this software directly from github with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper
```

2. Install a browser in playwright (if you haven't already). The program will use firefox by default.

```
playwright install firefox
```

3. Start up the program in `install` mode. This opens up a browser window. Log in to ChatGPT in the browser window, then stop the program.

```bash
chatgpt install
```

4. Restart the program without the `install` parameter to begin using it.

## Tutorials:

- Youtube Tutorial: [How To Use ChatGPT With Unity: Python And API Setup #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CthF8c8qk4c) includes a step by step guide to installing this repository on a windows machine
- This [Blog post](https://medium.com/geekculture/using-chatgpt-in-python-eeaed9847e72) provides a visual step-by-step guide for installing this library.

## Usage

### Shell

#### Command line arguments

Run `chatgpt --help`

#### One-shot mode

To run the CLI in one-shot mode, simply follow the command with the prompt you want to send to ChatGPT:

```
chatgpt Hello World!
```

#### Interacive mode

To run the CLI in interactive mode, execute it with no additional arguments:

```
chatgpt
```

Once the interactive shell is running, you can see a list of all commands with:

```
/help
```

...or get help for a specific command with:

```
/help <command>
```

### Python

To use the `ChatGPT` class as an API for talking to ChatGPT, create an instance of the class and use the `ask` method to send a message to OpenAI and receive the response. For example:

```python
from chatgpt_wrapper import ChatGPT

bot = ChatGPT()
response = bot.ask("Hello, world!")
print(response)  # prints the response from chatGPT
```

The say method takes a string argument representing the message to send to ChatGPT, and returns a string representing the response received from ChatGPT.

You may also stream the response as it comes in from ChatGPT in chunks using the `ask_stream` generator.

### Flask API (experimental)

- Run `python chatgpt_wrapper/gpt_api.py --port 5001` (default port is 5001) to start the server
- Test whether it is working using `python -m unittest test/api_test.py`
- See an example of interaction with api in `tests/example_api_call.py`

## Docker (experimental)

Build a image for testing `chatgpt-wrapper` with following commands.

```bash
docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it chatgpt-wrapper-container /bin/bash -c "chatgpt install"
```

Then, visit http://localhost:6901/vnc.html with password `headless` and login ChatGPT.

Then, turn back to terminal and enjoy the chat!
