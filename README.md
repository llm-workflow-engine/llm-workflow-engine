See below for details on using ChatGPT as an API from Python.

## Requirements

To use this repository, you need `setuptools` installed. You can install it using `pip install setuptools`. Make sure that you have the last version of pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`

To use the 'chatgpt-api' backend, you need a database backend (SQLite by default, any configurable in SQLAlchemy allowed).

## Installation

### Notes for Windows users

Most other operating systems come with SQLite (the default database choice) installed, Windows may not.

If not, you can grab the 32-bit or 64-bit DLL file from [https://www.sqlite.org/download.html](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html), then place the DLL in `C:\Windows\System32` directory.

You also may need to install Python, if so grab the latest stable package from [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) -- make sure to select the install option to `Add Python to PATH`.

For the `/editor` command to work, you'll need a command line editor installed and in your path. You can control which editor is used by setting the `EDITOR` environment variable to the name of the editor executable, e.g. `nano` or `vim`.

### Code

#### From packages

Install the latest version of this software directly from github with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper
```
#### From source (recommended for development)

* Install the latest version of this software directly from git:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper.git
  ```
* Install the the development package:
  ```bash
  cd chatgpt-wrapper
  pip install -e .
  ```

### Backend

The wrapper works with several differnt backends to connect to the ChatGPT models, and installation is different for each backend.

#### Playwright (browser-based)

* Pros:
  * Free or paid version available (as of this writing)
  * Fairly easy to set up for non-technical users
* Cons:
  * Slow (runs a full browser session)
  * Clunky authentication method
  * No model customizations
  * Third party controls your data

Install a browser in playwright (if you haven't already). The program will use firefox by default.

```
playwright install firefox
```

Start up the program in `install` mode:

```bash
chatgpt install
```

This opens up a browser window. Log in to ChatGPT in the browser window, walk through all the intro screens, then exit program.

```bash
1> /exit
```

Restart the program without the `install` parameter to begin using it.

```bash
chatgpt
```

#### API (REST-based)

* Pros:
  * Fast (many operations run locally for speed)
  * Simple API authentication
  * Full model customizations
  * You control your data
* Cons:
  * Only paid version available (as of this writing)
  * More complex setup suitable for technical users

Grab an API key from [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Export the key into your local environment:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
```

Windows users, see [here](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm) for how to edit environment variables.

Run the program with the 'config' command:

```bash
chatgpt config
```

This will show all the current configuration settings, the most important ones for installation are:

* **Config dir:** Where configuration files are stored
* **Current profile:** (shown in the 'Profile configuration' section)
* **Config file:** The configuration file current being used
* **Data dir:** The data storage directory

Find the 'Config file' setting, and copy the [config.sample.yaml](/config.sample.yaml) there:

On Linux:

 ```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/chatgpt-wrapper/profiles/default
cp config.sample.yaml ~/.config/chatgpt-wrapper/profiles/default/config.yaml
```

Then edit the settings in that file to taste.  You'll want to make sure `backend` is set to `chatgpt-api` in order to use the API.

##### Database configuration

The API backend requires a database server to store conversation data. The wrapper leverages [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for this.

The simplest supported database is SQLite (which is already installed on most modern operating systems), but you can use any database that is supported by SQLAlchemy.

Check the `database` setting from the `config` command above, which will show you the currently configured connection string for a default SQLite database.

If you're happy with that setting, nothing else needs to be done -- the database will be created automatically in that location when you run the program.

##### Initial user creation and login

Once the database is configured, run the program with no arguments:

```bash
chatgpt
```

It will recognize no users have been created, and prompt you to create the first user:

* Username: Required, no spaces or special characters
* Email: Optional
* Password: Optional, if not provided the user can log in without a password

Once the user is created, execute the `/login` command with the username:

```bash
/login [username]
```

Once you're logged in, you have full access to all commands.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The user authorization system from the command line is 'admin party' -- meaning every logged in user has admin privileges, including editing and deleting other users.


## Configuration

From a running `chatgpt` instance, execute `/config` to view the current configuration.

The output will show the location of the configuration directory, the name of
the configuration file (called a 'profile'), and the current configuration.

Configuration is optional, default values will be used if no configuration profile is
provided. The default configuation settings can be seen in
[config.sample.yaml](/config.sample.yaml) -- the file is commented with descriptions 
of the settings.

*NOTE:* Not all settings are available on all backends. See the example config for more information.

Command line arguments overrride custom configuration settings, which override default
configuration settings.

## Templates (alpha, subject to change)

The wrapper comes with a full template management system.

Templates allow storing text in template files, and quickly leveraging the contents as your user input.

Features:

 * Per-profile templates
 * Create/edit templates
 * `{{ variable }}` syntax substitution
 * Five different workflows for collecting variable values, editing, and running

See the various `/help template` commands for more information.

### Builtin variables

The wrapper exposes some builtin variables that can be used in templates:

 * `{{ clipboard }}` - Insert the contents of the clipboard

### Front matter

Templates may include front matter (see [examples](examples/templates)).

These front matter attributes have special functionality:

* title: Sets the title of new conversations to this value
* description: Displayed in the output of `/templates`
* model_customizations: A hash of model customizations to apply when the template is run (see `/config` for available model customizations)

All other attributes will be passed to the template as variable substitutions.

## Plugins (alpha, subject to change)

### Using plugins

1. Place the plugin file in either:
  * The main `plugins` directory of this module
  * A `plugins` directory in your profile

2. Enable the plugin in your configuration:

   ```yaml
   plugins:
     enabled:
       # This is a list of plugins to enable, each list item should be the name of a plugin file, without the extension.
       - test
   ```
   Note that setting `plugins.enabled` will overwrite the default enabled plugins. see `/config` for a list of default enabled plugins.

### Core plugins:

* **test:** Test plugin, echos back the command you give it
* **awesome:** Use a prompt from Awesome ChatGPT Prompts: [https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts)
* **database:** Send natural language commands to a database **WARNING: POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS -- DATA INTEGRITY CANNOT BE GUARANTEED.**
* **data_query:** Send natural language commands to a loaded file of structured data
* **shell:** Transform natural language into a shell command, and optionally execute it **WARNING: POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS -- YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR VALIDATING THE COMMAND RETURNED BY THE LLM, AND THE OUTCOME OF ITS EXECUTION.**
* **zap:** Send natural language commands to Zapier actions: [https://nla.zapier.com/get-started/](https://nla.zapier.com/get-started/)

### Writing plugins

There is currently no developer documentation for writing plugins.

The `plugins` directory has some default plugins, examining those will give a good idea for how to design a new one.

Currently, plugins for the shell can only add new commands. An instantiated plugin has access to these resources:

* `self.config`: The current instantiated Config object
* `self.log`: The instantiated Logger object
* `self.backend`: The instantiated backend
* `self.shell`: The instantiated shell

```
chatgpt Hello World!
```

#### Interactive mode

To run the CLI in interactive mode, execute it with no additional arguments:

```
chatgpt
```

Once the interactive shell is running, you can see a list of all commands with:

```
/help
```

...or get help for a specific command with:

```
/help <command>
```


## <a name="cliref"></a>Reference of CLI commands


### /new

Start a new conversation with the ChatGPT model. Each conversation is identified by an integer, starting from 1 and incrementing with each new conversation. Upon entering `/new`, the user is entered into the new conversation.


### /ask

Ask a question to ChatGPT within the current conversation. The user is prompted for input to be sent to the model. You need first call /new


### /title 

Allocates a title to the conversation that you are in.


#### Example:

```
/title testing chatgpt

```

You need to be inside a conversation before change it title




### Python

To use the `ChatGPT` class as an API for talking to ChatGPT, create an instance of the class and use the `ask` method to send a message to OpenAI and receive the response. For example:

```python
from chatgpt_wrapper import ChatGPT

bot = ChatGPT()
success, response, message = bot.ask("Hello, world!")
if success:
    print(response)
else:
    raise RuntimeError(message)
```

The say method takes a string argument representing the message to send to ChatGPT, and returns a string representing the response received from ChatGPT.

You may also stream the response as it comes in from ChatGPT in chunks using the `ask_stream` generator.

To pass custom configuration to ChatGPT, use the Config class:

```python
from chatgpt_wrapper import ChatGPT
from chatgpt_wrapper.core.config import Config

config = Config()
config.set('browser.debug', True)
bot = ChatGPT(config)
success, response, message = bot.ask("Hello, world!")
if success:
    print(response)
else:
    raise RuntimeError(message)
```

### Flask API (experimental)

- Run `python chatgpt_wrapper/gpt_api.py --port 5000` (default port is 5000) to start the server
- Install pytest: `pip install pytest`
- Test whether it is working using `pytest tests/integration/api_test.py`
- See an example of interaction with api in `tests/integration/example_api_call.py`

## Docker (experimental)

Build a image for testing `chatgpt-wrapper` with following commands.

```bash
docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it chatgpt-wrapper-container /bin/bash -c "chatgpt install"
```

Then, visit http://localhost:6901/vnc.html with password `headless` and login ChatGPT.

Then, turn back to terminal and enjoy the chat!

## Troubleshooting

### OpenAI system issues

**Oftentimes issues are related to upstream service problems with OpenAI, so please check [https://status.openai.com](https://status.openai.com) before concluding there's an issue with this codebase!**

### Playwright (browser-based) backend issues

It's possible that:

1. Your session has gone stale: Try issuing a `/session` command to refresh it
2. Your browser session information is corrupted: Try `chatgpt reinstall` and go through the login process again
3. You're running an outdated version of this project, or one of its dependencies: Completely reinstall the project and its dependencies
4. You're running into geolocation restrictions in OpenAI's security systems: Try proxying your requests through a VPN server in the US.

## Upgrading:

### Via pip

Until an official release exists, you'll need to uninstall and reinstall:

```sh
pip uninstall -y chatGPT
pip install chatGPT
```

### Via git

If the package was installed via `pip install -e`, simply pull in the latest changes from the repository:

```sh
git pull
```
